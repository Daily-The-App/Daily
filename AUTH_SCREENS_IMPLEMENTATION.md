# Auth Screens Implementation with AuthContext

This document explains how the authentication screens have been wired to use the AuthContext helpers.

## Overview

The auth screens are now integrated with the AuthContext to provide complete authentication functionality using Firebase Auth. All screens follow the pattern shown in the task example.

## Created Files

### 1. `app/(auth)/_layout.tsx`
- Stack navigation layout for all auth screens
- Configures screen options and status bar

### 2. `app/(auth)/index.tsx` 
- Landing page with options to sign in or create account
- Clean, branded interface directing users to authentication

### 3. `app/(auth)/sign-in.tsx`
- Main sign-in screen using `signInWithEmail` from AuthContext
- Includes form validation, error handling, and loading states
- Links to sign-up and forgot password screens

### 4. `app/(auth)/sign-up.tsx`
- User registration using `signUpWithEmail` from AuthContext
- Password confirmation validation
- Error handling for account creation

### 5. `app/(auth)/forgot-password.tsx`
- Password reset functionality using `sendPasswordReset` from AuthContext
- Success state showing confirmation message
- Navigation back to sign-in

### 6. `app/(auth)/simple-sign-in.tsx`
- Minimal implementation exactly matching the task example
- Demonstrates the core pattern for using AuthContext

## AuthContext Integration

All screens follow this pattern from the task example:

```tsx
import { useAuth } from '../../src/contexts/AuthContext';

export default function SignIn() {
  const { signInWithEmail } = useAuth();
  const [email, setEmail] = useState('');
  const [password, setPassword] = useState('');
  const [err, setErr] = useState<string | null>(null);

  const onSubmit = async () => {
    setErr(null);
    try {
      await signInWithEmail(email.trim(), password);
      // Redirect handled automatically by the AuthGate when user becomes non-null
    } catch (e: any) {
      setErr(e?.message ?? 'Failed to sign in');
    }
  };
  
  // ... rest of component
}
```

## Key Features

### Authentication Methods Used
- `signInWithEmail(email, password)` - Email/password sign-in
- `signUpWithEmail(email, password)` - Account creation
- `sendPasswordReset(email)` - Password reset emails
- `signOut()` - User sign-out (available for future use)

### Error Handling
- Proper try/catch blocks around auth operations
- User-friendly error messages displayed
- Loading states during authentication

### User Experience
- Automatic redirects handled by AuthGate when user becomes authenticated
- Form validation before submission
- Clear navigation between auth screens
- Consistent styling and branding

### Navigation Flow
```
/(auth)/index → /(auth)/sign-in ↔ /(auth)/sign-up
                    ↓
               /(auth)/forgot-password
```

## Usage

Users can now:
1. Navigate to auth screens to sign in or create accounts
2. Use email/password authentication via Firebase
3. Reset forgotten passwords
4. Be automatically redirected when authentication succeeds

The screens are fully wired to the AuthContext and ready for production use with the existing AuthGate component.
